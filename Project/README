URL: https://elinux.org/ECE497_Project_-_DIY_Emergency_Button

This project is to design and build a remote and portable pushbutton which could send out emergency text or call once it is pressed. 
The main idea is to use Twilio API on the BeagleBone Blue to implement those functionalities.

To run the project, do: sudo python button.py
